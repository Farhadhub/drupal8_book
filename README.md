Repo initialized for Drupal8 for Absolute Beginners.

NOTE:  After switching to a different branch of the code presented here,
for the hello world module for example, you'll usually need to 
uninstall the hello world module, and then reinstall it.  You also
may clear the drupal cache via drush or at admin/config/development/performance.

It should not be necessary but if nothing else works, reinstall drupal, start from
scratch and then install the different version on the hello world module, I believe
this will only be necessary as an extreme circumstance until drupal 8 matures a 
bit more.  Word on the street is some big company(s) are migrating to Drupal 8
by the summer, so Drupal 8 is sure to grow up quickly.
